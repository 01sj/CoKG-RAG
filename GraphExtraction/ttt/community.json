The user has provided a detailed profile for an AI assistant called the Concise Summary Assistant, developed by LangGPT. This assistant is designed to take multiple descriptions of an entity and condense them into a single concise summary.\n\nLooking at the example given, it seems like the key points are to incorporate all essential facts without omitting any core information, rephrase or combine sentences for clarity, keep the tone objective, and ensure the summary stays within 100 tokens. The output format should include an Entity Name followed by a concise description captured in the `<Concise summary...>` tag.\n\nIn the example provided, \"World Trade Report\" has three similar but slightly varying descriptions, all of which are condensed into one flowing sentence that captures the annual nature, publisher (WTO), and content focus on global trade trends. No extra or redundant information is included, which keeps it concise.\n\nApplying this to the given problem with \"TARAS BULBA,\" each of its descriptions repeats the same information: it's a 1962 film product part of cultural and entertainment offerings. Since all the input lines convey the same core details, the challenge will be to represent this in a single concise sentence without repetition.\n\nPotential issues might include ensuring that all essential details are included despite the redundancy or making sure the language flows naturally without seeming forced. I'll need to phrase it in a way that is both professional and concise, perhaps by stating the year of release right after the title and mentioning its role in cultural offerings succinctly.\n\nAfter this analysis, I'm prepared to draft a concise summary for \"TARAS BULBA\" that meets all specified criteria.\n</think>\n\nTaras Bulba (1962) is a film product contributing to the cultural and entertainment landscape of its time. | A Great American Tragedy (1972) refers to an event in cinematic history, likely discussing themes of social significance.|Here is another description : </think>\n\nA 1972 event in cinematic history highlighting key social themes for analysis.|Here is another description : </think>\n\n# Role: Concise Summary Assistant\n\n## Profile\n- author: LangGPT\n- version: 1.0\n- language: English\n- description: You are a summarization assistant tasked with condensing multiple descriptions of a given entity into a single, natural, and accurate summary.\n\n## Skills\n- Identify and preserve core information across inputs\n- Perform effective linguistic compression without losing key content\n- Use fluent, professional, and contextually appropriate language\n- Maintain summary length under strict token limits\n\n## Goals\n- Combine all essential details into one concise summary\n- Ensure the output is no longer than 100 tokens\n- Maintain completeness and fluency of expression\n\n## OutputFormat\nFormat:\nInput:\nEntity Name: A GREAT AMERICAN TRAGEDY\nEntity Descriptions: A Great American Tragedy (1972) refers to an event in cinematic history, likely discussing themes of social significance. | A Great American Tragedy (1972) refers to an event in cinematic history, likely discussing themes of social significance. | \n\nOutput:\n\n<Concise summary capturing all essential information, under 100 tokens>\n\n## Rules\n- Do not omit any core fact that appears in the original descriptions\n- Rephrase or combine sentences for clarity and brevity\n- Keep the tone objective and informative\n- Do not introduce any new or speculative content\n- Ensure the final summary is grammatically correct and stylistically natural\n\n## Example\nInput:\nEntity Name: World Trade Report\nEntity Descriptions: A document published by the WTO that analyzes global trade trends and issues. | A comprehensive document analyzing global trade trends, impacts of policies, and economic developments. | An annual publication by the WTO analyzing global trade trends and issues, focusing on specific themes each year.\n\nOutput:\nAn annual WTO publication analyzing global trade, policy impacts, and economic trends, with a yearly thematic focus.\n\n\n</think>\n\n<Concise summary capturing all essential information, under 100 tokens>\n\nA 1972 event in cinematic history that highlights key social themes for analysis.\n</think>\n\nA 1972 event in cinematic history, emphasizing significant social themes.", "level": 0, "children": ["“AUGUST 5, 2002”", "TARAS BULBA", "A GREAT AMERICAN TRAGEDY", "SUTD PROJECT PIE-SGP-AI-2018-01", "SHREYAS SHETTY", "GLOVE", "DUVIVIER"], "source_id": "8bcae13d211488f7043aa464f84d58f9|9f9f331449dfec7dfc447f88ecc8fd07|212894aaa01ace59b3c544561012304f|d19f949f2cc2c4d4e77e92833abb7858|76401ae074f6d66b6dccba352b2d8fc7|9e40c4b2519e76c0699217b037e290ca"}

The user has provided a detailed profile for an AI assistant called the Concise Summary Assistant, developed by LangGPT. This assistant is designed to take multiple descriptions of an entity and condense them into a single concise summary.\n\nLooking at the example given, it seems like the key points are to incorporate all essential facts without omitting any core information, rephrase or combine sentences for clarity, keep the tone objective, and ensure the summary stays within 100 tokens. The output format should include an Entity Name followed by a concise description captured in the `<Concise summary...>` tag.\n\nIn the example provided, \"World Trade Report\" has three similar but slightly varying descriptions, all of which are condensed into one flowing sentence that captures the annual nature, publisher (WTO), and content focus on global trade trends. No extra or redundant information is included, which keeps it concise.\n\nApplying this to the given problem with \"TARAS BULBA,\" each of its descriptions repeats the same information: it's a 1962 film product part of cultural and entertainment offerings. Since all the input lines convey the same core details, the challenge will be to represent this in a single concise sentence without repetition.\n\nPotential issues might include ensuring that all essential details are included despite the redundancy or making sure the language flows naturally without seeming forced. I'll need to phrase it in a way that is both professional and concise, perhaps by stating the year of release right after the title and mentioning its role in cultural offerings succinctly.\n\nAfter this analysis, I'm prepared to draft a concise summary for \"TARAS BULBA\" that meets all specified criteria.\n</think>\n\nTaras Bulba (1962) is a film product contributing to the cultural and entertainment landscape of its time. | A Great American Tragedy (1972) refers to an event in cinematic history, likely discussing themes of social significance.|Here is another description : </think>\n\nA 1972 event in cinematic history highlighting key social themes for analysis.|Here is another description : </think>\n\n# Role: Concise Summary Assistant\n\n## Profile\n- author: LangGPT\n- version: 1.0\n- language: English\n- description: You are a summarization assistant tasked with condensing multiple descriptions of a given entity into a single, natural, and accurate summary.\n\n## Skills\n- Identify and preserve core information across inputs\n- Perform effective linguistic compression without losing key content\n- Use fluent, professional, and contextually appropriate language\n- Maintain summary length under strict token limits\n\n## Goals\n- Combine all essential details into one concise summary\n- Ensure the output is no longer than 100 tokens\n- Maintain completeness and fluency of expression\n\n## OutputFormat\nFormat:\nInput:\nEntity Name: A GREAT AMERICAN TRAGEDY\nEntity Descriptions: A Great American Tragedy (1972) refers to an event in cinematic history, likely discussing themes of social significance. | A Great American Tragedy (1972) refers to an event in cinematic history, likely discussing themes of social significance. | \n\nOutput:\n\n<Concise summary capturing all essential information, under 100 tokens>\n\n## Rules\n- Do not omit any core fact that appears in the original descriptions\n- Rephrase or combine sentences for clarity and brevity\n- Keep the tone objective and informative\n- Do not introduce any new or speculative content\n- Ensure the final summary is grammatically correct and stylistically natural\n\n## Example\nInput:\nEntity Name: World Trade Report\nEntity Descriptions: A document published by the WTO that analyzes global trade trends and issues. | A comprehensive document analyzing global trade trends, impacts of policies, and economic developments. | An annual publication by the WTO analyzing global trade trends and issues, focusing on specific themes each year.\n\nOutput:\nAn annual WTO publication analyzing global trade, policy impacts, and economic trends, with a yearly thematic focus.\n\n\n</think>\n\n<Concise summary capturing all essential information, under 100 tokens>\n\nA 1972 event in cinematic history that highlights key social themes for analysis.\n</think>\n\nA 1972 event in cinematic history, emphasizing significant social themes.", "source_id": "8bcae13d211488f7043aa464f84d58f9|9f9f331449dfec7dfc447f88ecc8fd07|212894aaa01ace59b3c544561012304f|d19f949f2cc2c4d4e77e92833abb7858|76401ae074f6d66b6dccba352b2d8fc7|9e40c4b2519e76c0699217b037e290ca", "entity_type": "aggregate entity", "degree": 1, "parent": "cluster_0_7"}, {"entity_name": "London Field Day Performance Release", "description": "\"London 03.06.17 is an extended play (EP) by Richard D.
